## Privacy & Data Handling

- **AstroOM has no telemetry.** Nothing is phoned home except the requests you explicitly make to the job boards and to your configured LLM provider.
- **Your personal data lives in one place:** the `profile/` directory you create from `profile.example/`. The application only reads it; it never writes to it and never bundles it into a release.
- **`profile/` is git-ignored.** Keep your résumé and testimonials out of version control and out of bug reports.
- Profile text is sent to whichever LLM provider your preset names (the shipped presets target OpenRouter). Treat it the same way you would any data you submit to a third-party API.
- A public Indeed mobile client key is compiled into the binary; it is not a user secret. See "Credentials" below.

---

## Core Pipeline Architecture

AstroOM organizes job application automation into 8 decoupled, cache-backed pipeline stages:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S1["Stage 1: Acquire Jobs<br/>(Indeed & LinkedIn JobSpy query)"] --> S2["Stage 2: Process Data<br/>(Deduplication & Keyword filtering)"]
    S2 --> S3["Stage 3: Job Cloth<br/>(Candidate Profile grounding)"]
    S3 --> S4["Stage 4: Enrich Jobs<br/>(Detail page & description fetch)"]
    S4 --> S5["Stage 5: Remote Eval<br/>(Optional remote/geo verification)"]
    S5 --> S6["Stage 6: Job Judge<br/>(Multidimensional scoring & gating)"]
    S6 --> S7["Stage 7: Make Materials<br/>(Tailored resume & cover letters)"]
    S7 --> S8["Stage 8: Deploy Materials<br/>(Archival & optional cloud export)"]
```

1. **Acquire Jobs**: Headless querying of LinkedIn and Indeed using resilient HTTP session retry policies, rotating proxy pools, and provider-specific header sets.
2. **Process Data**: Normalizes listings, removes blocklisted companies and titles, and filters out previously seen opportunities via SQLite.
3. **Job Cloth**: Reconciles raw job requirements against the candidate's skills and background.
4. **Enrich Jobs**: Fetches complete long-form job descriptions and employer profiles.
5. **Remote Eval**: Evaluates residency requirements, time zones, and remote eligibility rules.
6. **Job Judge**: Evaluates opportunities against candidate-defined gates (seniority, compensation, tech stack match) to generate a fit score (0–100).
7. **Make Materials**: Generates tailored resumes and cover letters for qualified opportunities.
8. **Deploy Materials**: Packages materials into formatted markdown files, JSON deployment payloads, and optional cloud storage sync via Google Apps Script.

Each stage writes a JSON artifact plus a companion `<artifact>.json.manifest.json` sidecar containing a SHA-256 digest, so a resumed or third-party artifact can always be verified with `astroom artifact verify <file>`.

## LLM Provider Support & Model Caveats

> [!NOTE]
> AstroOM speaks the OpenAI chat-completions protocol, so it can target OpenRouter as well as any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (local Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, Groq, …).
>
> - **The shipped presets all target OpenRouter** (`config/presets.json`). To use another endpoint, either override the base URL for every stage with `--llm-base-url <url>`, or add a preset with your own `provider` and `base_url`.
> - **Prompt Adherence & JSON Formatting:** High-parameter reasoning models (e.g. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o) reliably produce valid schema-compliant JSON during the `jobCloth` and `jobJudge` phases. Smaller local models (7B or 8B parameters) may occasionally omit required delimiters or hallucinate keys.
> - **Context Windows:** Ensure your local LLM server context window is configured for at least 16,000 tokens to handle full resume inventories and lengthy job postings without silent truncation.
> - **Prompt presets:** Every stage selects a preset by name from `config/presets.json`. Each preset names its own `promptTemplate`; the tree ships both compact `*-mini.txt` prompts (referenced by the shipped presets) and longer full-size variants you can switch to by editing a preset.
> - **Prompts are yours to tune.** `prompts/` and `sysprompts/` are plain text with `{placeholder}` tokens. They encode one candidate's screening philosophy, including a hard-coded work-jurisdiction and commute area — edit them to match your own search before relying on the scores.

## Quick Start Guide

> [!NOTE]
> The AOM contributors highly recommend the use of a codex / AI coding assistant for rapidly configuring the software with your application materials!

### 1. Prerequisites

**Option A — use the prebuilt binary.** No toolchain needed.

The repository ships prebuilt release binaries at `target/release/astroom` for Linux (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, glibc) and `target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/astroom.exe` for Windows (`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`). They need the `config/`, `prompts/`, and `sysprompts/` directories alongside them, which is why the binaries are distributed inside the repository tree rather than as bare downloads.

```bash
# Linux
./target/release/astroom --help
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\target\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\release\astroom.exe --help
```

**Option B — build from source.** Requires the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (stable; CI uses `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`) and a C compiler (GCC/Clang on Linux; MSVC C++ Build Tools or MinGW-w64 on Windows) for the bundled SQLite build.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sudoTni/AstroOM.git
cd AstroOM

# Linux
cargo build --release        # -> target/release/astroom
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
cargo build --release        # -> target\release\astroom.exe
```

### 2. Candidate Profile Setup

AstroOM keeps all personal job-search data outside the code, in a `profile/` directory. The repository ships an annotated template:

```bash
# Linux
cp -r profile.example profile
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
Copy-Item -Recurse profile.example profile
```

Then replace the sample content in each file. See [`profile.example/README.md`](profile.example/README.md) for a per-field table. In short:

| File | Required | What goes in it |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `my_resume.txt` | **yes** | Your full plain-text résumé. Every factual claim in the generated materials must be defensible from this file. |
| `search_terms.txt` | **yes** | Target job titles, one per line. `#` comments and blank lines are ignored. |
| `my_professional_title.txt` | no | Your current professional title; `makeMaterials` tailors it per role. |
| `my_professional_summary.txt` | no | Your professional summary; tailored per role. |
| `my_key_skills.txt` | no | Comma-separated list of core competencies. |
| `my_testimonials.txt` | no | Quotes about you. Used only as qualitative evidence — never to establish a technology, a number of years, a certification, education, or clearance. |
| `company_filters.txt` | no | Company/agency names to exclude (case-insensitive substring match). |
| `title_filters.txt` | no | Title keywords to exclude (case-insensitive substring match). |

> The template content describes a **fictional** candidate. Replace it before your first run, or the generated application materials will describe someone who does not exist.

### 3. Credentials

AstroOM itself **reads no environment variables.** Every setting reaches it through an explicit CLI flag, passed with either:

- `--api-key "<YOUR_KEY>"`, or
- `--api-key-file /path/to/key` (mutually exclusive with `--api-key`).

For convenience the wrapper scripts (`astro_launcher.bash` / `astro_launcher.ps1`) read `AOM_OR_API_KEY` from a local `.env` and forward it:

```bash
# Linux
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env          # set AOM_OR_API_KEY
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
Copy-Item .env.example .env
notepad .env          # set AOM_OR_API_KEY
```

`.env` is git-ignored. Never commit a real key; rotate any key that is ever committed or shared.

The Indeed scraper uses a public Indeed mobile client key that is compiled into the binary. It is not a user secret. Supply your own with `--indeed-api-key` (or `AOM_INDEED_API_KEY`) if you have an Indeed API credential.

### 4. Running the Pipeline

Run the full 8-phase pipeline with the wrapper script:

```bash
# Linux
./astro_launcher.bash
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
# If script execution is restricted on your system, enable it for the current process:
# Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\astro_launcher.ps1
```

The wrapper applies a tuned policy argv (presets, provider routing, `--remote-only`, cost tracking, internet watchdog) and appends any arguments you pass it **last**, so they override those defaults:

```bash
# Linux
./astro_launcher.bash --batch 50 --results-wanted 500 --clean
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\astro_launcher.ps1 --batch 50 --results-wanted 500 --clean
```

Or invoke the binary directly:

```bash
# Linux
./target/release/astroom run-pipeline \
  --job-provider indeed,linkedin \
  --profile-dir ./profile \
  --api-key "<YOUR_KEY>" \
  --jobcloth-preset jc_glm-5.3-flash \
  --remoteeval-preset re_glm-5.3-flash \
  --jobjudge-preset jep_glm-5.3-flash \
  --makematerials-preset rop_glm-5.3-flash \
  --batch 25 --sleep 2 --results-wanted 200 --remote-only true
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\target\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\release\astroom.exe run-pipeline `
  --job-provider indeed,linkedin `
  --profile-dir .\profile `
  --api-key "<YOUR_KEY>" `
  --jobcloth-preset jc_glm-5.3-flash `
  --remoteeval-preset re_glm-5.3-flash `
  --jobjudge-preset jep_glm-5.3-flash `
  --makematerials-preset rop_glm-5.3-flash `
  --batch 25 --sleep 2 --results-wanted 200 --remote-only true
```

Validate the setup before spending any tokens:

```bash
# Linux
./target/release/astroom preflight --profile-dir ./profile --json
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\target\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\release\astroom.exe preflight --profile-dir .\profile --json
```

## CLI Command Reference

All subcommands support `--help` for comprehensive option listings.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `run-pipeline` | Execute the complete end-to-end 8-phase acquisition and materials generation pipeline |
| `acquire-jobs` | Query job board platforms (Indeed, LinkedIn) and write raw acquired listings |
| `processData` | Filter acquired listings by company, title, and database deduplication |
| `jobCloth` | Ground job descriptions against candidate profile data |
| `enrich-jobs` | Fetch detailed long-form descriptions and company metadata |
| `jobJudge` | Score and filter jobs based on candidate gates and alignment rules |
| `makeMaterials` | Generate optimized, tailored resumes and cover letters for qualified opportunities |
| `preflight` | Validate system prerequisites, runtime paths, API keys, and model presets |
| `jobDb` | Inspect the local SQLite deduplication repository (`status`, `verify`, `backup`, `rotate-backups`) |
| `artifact` | Verify an artifact against its companion SHA-256 manifest (`artifact verify <file>`) |

**Stage 5 (Remote Eval) has no standalone subcommand.** It runs inside `run-pipeline` when `--remote-only` is enabled, which is the only supported way to use it.

### Global Flags
- `--verbose`, `-v`: Enable verbose debug logging output.
- `--no-color`, `--no-colors`: Disable ANSI terminal coloring and gradient banners.
- `--json`: Output machine-readable JSON records (implies banner suppression, `--log-level error`, and JSON log format).
- `--log-level <level>`: Set minimum log level (`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `success`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`).
- `--log-format <fmt>`: `pretty` (default) or `json`.
- `--data-dir`, `--log-dir`, `--materials-dir`, `--profile-dir`: Override the default directories.
- `--llm-base-url <url>`: Override the OpenAI-compatible endpoint for every stage.
- `--indeed-api-key <key>`: Supply your own Indeed API credential.
- `-hr`, `--hide-reasoning`, `--no-show-reasoning`: Suppress reasoning output and force non-streaming requests.
- `-sr`, `--show-reasoning`, `--show-reasoning-tokens`: Print reasoning tokens and stream responses live.
- `--api-key`, `--api-key-file`: LLM credential (mutually exclusive).
- `--max-llm-requests`, `--max-llm-output-tokens`, `--max-total-llm-output-tokens`, `--llm-deadline-ms`: LLM spend and time budgets.
- `--log-llm-payloads`, `--log-max-payload-length`: Write every outbound LLM request body to `logs/*_payload_logs/`.

---

## Google Apps Script Deployment

Stage 8 can export materials with `rclone` (`--deploy --deploy-destination <remote>`), which is what the built-in pipeline uses.

[`deployMaterials.gs`](deployMaterials.gs) is an **optional, richer alternative** that runs entirely inside Google Workspace: it reads generated markdown from Drive, uses an LLM to discover company contact addresses, renders tailored Google Docs and PDFs, and creates or sends Gmail drafts.

To use it:
1. Open [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Copy the contents of [`deployMaterials.gs`](deployMaterials.gs) into your script editor.
3. In **Project Settings → Script Properties**, define every key listed in the file's `SCRIPT_PROPERTIES` block — including the source, target, processed, and template folder IDs, your `APPLICANT_NAME` and `APPLICANT_EMAIL`, the log spreadsheet and folder, and your `OR_API_KEY`. No credential is hard-coded in the file.
4. Run `deployMaterials()` directly, or deploy as an API executable.

## Supported Platforms

| Target | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | **Primary target.** Full native Linux support. Prebuilt binary shipped. |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` / `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | **Windows native.** Full native Windows support via `astro_launcher.ps1` or direct CLI execution. |
| Other POSIX (macOS, other Linux architectures) | Build from source with `cargo build --release`. |

AstroOM natively dual-targets Linux and Windows. On Linux, it uses POSIX pipes and descriptors to tee its execution log (`src/logging/execution_log.rs`) and reads `/proc/self/status` for process metrics. On Windows, it uses Win32 standard handle redirection and pipes with virtual terminal processing for ANSI styling.

---

## Development

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

The test suite is fully offline. LLM-dependent paths run against a local mock OpenAI-compatible server (`tests/common/mod.rs`), and the Node-parity differential tests replay committed oracles from `tests/fixtures/`. The Node oracle generators in `tests/differential/` and the Node-vs-Rust CLI differ (`run_cli_differential.sh`) require a separate Node checkout of the predecessor project and are intentionally not part of `cargo test`.

### Reproducible releases

`Cargo.lock` is committed. For a release build that contains no machine-specific paths, remap the build paths:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="--remap-path-prefix=$(pwd)=/astroom --remap-path-prefix=$HOME=/build" \
  cargo build --release
sha256sum target/release/astroom > astroom-$(cat VERSION)-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.sha256
```

Without the remap, Rust embeds source paths in panic-location strings, which leaks the builder's directory layout into the artifact.
